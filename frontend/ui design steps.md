Suggested Order of Implementation


Move the stepper to the top and make it persistent.

Next Steps for Building Out the Stepper
1. Partial Fill for Sections
Current: Each section is either filled or not.
Next: Allow each section’s segment to fill proportionally as the user completes steps within that section.
Pass a sectionProgress array (values 0–1 for each section) instead of just booleans.
The bar segment for each section fills according to its progress.
2. Wire Up to Real Step State
Connect the stepper’s progress to your actual form state:
Track which step the user is on within each section.
Calculate progress for each section and pass it to the stepper.
3. Clickable Sections (Optional)
Allow users to click on a section to jump to it (with validation to prevent skipping required steps).
4. Visual Tweaks
Add subtle animations for progress.
Highlight the current section more distinctly.
Add tooltips or helper text if needed.



Refactor one step/page to use the new full-page layout (no card).
Implement yes/no button questions for that step.
Update navigation buttons for consistency.
Repeat for other steps.
Design and implement the review page last.
